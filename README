USAGE: Upload this file to a PHP-capable server, browse to the full URL of the file,
and add two parameters, a and b, to the end of the URL to specify which numbers
you would like to find the GCD of.

EXAMPLE: http://www.example.com/gcd.php?a=12&b=20 would give you the GCD of 12 and 20 (=4),
as well as show you the steps used using Euclid's algorithm to obtain the final answer.

OTHER NOTES:	x*b + y*a = r
				r is the remainder
				q is the quotient
				i is the iteration
